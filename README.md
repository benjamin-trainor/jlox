# Lox Interpreter (Java)

A Java implementation of the Lox programming language from *Crafting Interpreters* by Bob Nystrom, with additional features and experiments in language design, runtime execution, and correctness.

## About this project

This project explores:

- **Language parsing & AST construction** – building a recursive-descent parser from scratch.
- **Runtime execution** – designing an interpreter that evaluates expressions and manages program state.
- **Memory & scoping** – implementing lexical scoping, closures, and variable environments.
- **Error handling & correctness** – designing robust runtime behavior for invalid input and runtime errors.

Through this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of:

- How programming languages execute code under the hood.
- Core compiler/interpreter concepts (lexing, parsing, evaluation).
- Type systems, expression evaluation, and the design of a minimal runtime.

---

## Features

- Full expression evaluation (arithmetic, logical, comparison)
- Variable declarations, assignments, and scopes
- Control flow (if, while)
- Functions and closures
- Detailed error reporting and recovery
- Optional: experiments with extending Lox syntax

## Why this matters

This repo demonstrates my focus on **systems thinking, correctness, and backend engineering fundamentals**. Understanding interpreters and runtimes builds transferable skills for:

- Designing scalable backend systems
- Memory-safe concurrent execution
- Correctness-critical infrastructure
- Rust/Go backend services
